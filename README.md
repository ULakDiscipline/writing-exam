# Amanda's Notes:

## Full disclosure

I am VERY rusty with APIs, Swagger, website creation and the like - I've been working in MS Word ONLY for the last year. I chose the second task as it straddled my two worlds a little better than the first, which would have led me spending a couple of days trying to relearn enough to write a halfway decent tutorial. 

## Thought process
Depending on how these Guides are published (print, online only, separately, in one larger text, in an FAQ-style list, etc.) I'd create a global What's New for all audiences that would cater to broad UI and core functionality changes. These elements affect everyone and having them in one place avoids repetition. 

Using a single source tool would allow a "write once, use often" approach. 

For each of the notes provided by this fictional person, I would have asked the same set of questions: 

* What is this new feature/bug/improvement? 
* How does it work?
* Why would someone use it? 
* When would someone use it? 
* How do I get to it right now? 

I'd usually use a lot of images, but I'm not familiar with GitHub enough - and also ran out of time to investigate relative image storage and placement using Markdown. 


The questions I added for the fictional SMEs would typically be for each item. If I'm asking the question when I read a help topic, chances are someone else is too. 

(There is, of course, a place for FAQs, but I think those questions should be more general to the product, rather than a specific piece of information related to a specific release.)
